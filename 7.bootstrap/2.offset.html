                I had never seen a house on fire before, 
                so, one evening when I heard fire engines with loud alarm 
                bells rushing past my house. I quickly ran out and, a few 
                streets away, joined a large crowd of people. We could see the 
                fire only from a distance because the police would not allow any 
                one near the building on fire.
