                I had never seen a house on fire before, 
                so, one evening when I heard fire engines with 
                loud alarm bells rushing past my house. I quickly ran out
                and, a few streets away, joined a large crowd of people. 
                We could see the fire only from a distance because the police
                would not allow any one near the building on fire.
